A version of Daniel Bernstein (djb) and Tanja Lange (hyperelliptic)'s
"NaCl: Networking and Cryptography library", with minimal changes to
compile as a shared library.

To build, run:

  make && make install PREFIX=/foo

That will install headers into $PREFIX/include/nacl/ and libnacl into
$PREFIX/lib.  See the Makefile for how to override these locations.
$PREFIX defaults to /usr/local.

The main NaCL site is:

  http://nacl.cr.yp.to/

I have verified that the release-20110221 tag corresponds to the
20110221 release tarball from
http://hyperelliptic.org/nacl/nacl-20110221.tar.bz2, though you are
encouraged to do your own verification.

Unlike libsodium, which aims to be a much more conventionally packaged
version of NaCl, the few patches I have added are meant to be minimal
and easily verified.

I mostly followed the procedure on http://wiki.ucis.nl/NaCl/Shared,
though I did not change the crypto_box interface as they did.
